This game is called Crystal Clicker.

Four crystals are shown at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on any crystal will update your total score. Each crystal has a hidden value, and the only way to know that value is to click on it.

The player will see a target value that the computer has randomly selected. The player will click crystals and attempt to reach the target value. If they succeed, they will see their wins increase by one. If they fail (their total score goes above the target value) then their total losses will increment by one.

A win or a lose will result in the target value changing, all four crystals getting new random values, and the total score returning to zero.
